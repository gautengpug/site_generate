Summary: Feedback on the first meetup event.

The day was 12 April 2014 and the location was the House4Hack in Centurion.


After some quick discussions in the somewhat slow-moving GPUG group, the first ever Python meetup was to be hosted in Gauteng!

###After some basic introductions and setup, we had 2 topics planned for the day:

####First up: Tobie presenting a talk on [iPython](http://ipython.org/)

Tobie showed us how versatile iPython is, with a variety of demos. I especially enjoyed the 3D modelling from data and combining iPython with statistical packages.

Tobie would like to encourage the use of Python at work, especially as it blows Excel out of the water in functionality! We're rooting for you in that regard Tobie!


####Second topic: Iwan presenting a talk on a home-grown web-framework

The [Reahl web-framework](http://www.reahl.org/) is quite fascinating in that you can build your webapp in Python!

We have many Django/Flask/other-web-framework users in GPUG, so this framework is quite relevant to a lot of us.

Iwan decided to take us through a couple of demos. Unfortunately, my virtualbox with DamnSmallLinux kept crashing on me so I couldn't get to run the code :(

Most of the guys did manage to get their systems running with the code, but we did lose out on a bit of time with system setup.


###About the [House4Hack](http://www.house4hack.co.za/):

H4H is an awesome venue. A bit hard to find if it is your first time, but a pretty awesome hackerspace.

It has everything a pythonista would need, so all you'd require is your laptop and charger (maybe a double-pin plug in case!).


Our next meetup is scheduled for 17 May 2014, starting at 13.00 or 13.30.

We look forward to seeing more people come through at the next event.
