  * __Managing the Dlab with Python__ (_by [Mandla Mbuli](http://mandla.me)_)

    I am imagining a multi-part talk where I talk about how I used Python in
    the past 3 years to help me in managing the Computer Lab. The topics would
    be as follows:

    1. __Managing the Dlab with Python part 1: *Salt*__
       This is a talk about how to set up and work with salt and how I used it
       to manage Windows and Ubuntu machine in the lab.

    2. __Managing the Dlab with Python part 2: *Python and the LDAP*__
       This is a talk on how I used Python to shield me from working with LDAP
       commands a lot.

    3. __Managing the Dlab with Python part 3: *RESTlike Flask interface*__
       This is talk about how I used Flask to make a RESTlike interface which I
       use to manage users and computer information in the lab and to generate
       some things which I need for the lab.

    4. __Managing the Dlab with Python part 4: *Fabric for deployments*__
       Using Fabric to deploy my website

    5. __Managing the Dlab with Python part 5: *Descriptors and Validation*__
       This talk is about how I discovered Descriptors and I used them to write
       the logic for validating user information in the eieldap package.
